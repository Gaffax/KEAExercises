public class Eleven {
//	11. Write a method called symmetricSetDifference that accepts two Sets as parameters and returns a new Set
//	containing their symmetric set difference (that is, the set of elements contained in either of the two sets but not in
//	both). For example, the symmetric difference between the sets {1, 4, 7, 9} and {2, 4, 5, 6, 7} is {1, 2,
//	5, 6, 9}.
