//	4. Write a method called partition that accepts a list of integers and an integer value E as its parameter, and rearranges
//	(partitions) the list so that all the elements with values less than E occur before all elements with values greater than E.
//	The exact order of the elements is unimportant, so long as all elements less than E appear before all elements greater than
//	E. For example, for the linked list (15, 1, 6, 12, –3, 4, 8, 21, 2, 30, –1, 9), one acceptable ordering of
//	the list after a call of partition(list, 5) would be (–1, 1, 2, 4, –3, 12, 8, 21, 6, 30, 15, 9). You
//	may assume that the list contains no duplicates and does not contain the element value E.
