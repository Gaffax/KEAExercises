	up to the maximum in the numbers list, store only 2 and all odd numbers from 3 upward. Second, write code to
	ensure that if the first number in the numbers list ever reaches the square root of the maximum, all remaining values
	from the numbers list are moved into the primes list. (Why is this a valid operation?)
