//	11. Write a recursive method called isReverse that accepts 
//	two strings as parameters and returns true if the two
//	strings contain the same sequence of characters as each other 
//	but in the opposite order (ignoring capitalization), and
//	false otherwise. For example, the call of isReverse("hello", "eLLoH") 
//	would return true. The empty string,
//	as well as any one-letter string, is considered to be its own reverse.
