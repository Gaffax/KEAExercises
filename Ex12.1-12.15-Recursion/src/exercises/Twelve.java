public class Twelve {
//	12. Write a recursive method called indexOf that accepts 
//	two strings as parameters and that returns the starting index
//	of the first occurrence of the second string inside the 
//	first string (or 1 if not found). For example, the call of
//	indexOf("Barack Obama", "bam")would return 8. (Strings 
//	already have an indexOf method, but you may
//	not call it in your solution.)
