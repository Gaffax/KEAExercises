//	15. The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal that is defined as follows: The construction of the Sierpinski carpet begins with a
//	square. The square is cut into nine congruent subsquares in a 3-by-3 grid, with the central subsquare removed. The
//	same process is then applied recursively to the eight other subsquares. Figure 12.7 shows the first few iterations of
//	the carpet.
//	P(n,r) =
//	n!
//	(n - r)!
//	Figure 12.7 Sierpinski carpet
//	Figure 12.8 Cantor set
//	Write a program to draw the carpet on a DrawingPanel recursively.
	
	
	
//	Nope... Not gonna happen.
