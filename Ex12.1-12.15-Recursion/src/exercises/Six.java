public class Six {
//	6. Write a recursive method called writeSquares that accepts 
//	an integer parameter n and prints the first n squares
//	separated by commas, with the odd squares in descending order 
//	followed by the even squares in ascending order. For
//	example, writeSquares(8); prints the following output:
//	49, 25, 9, 1, 4, 16, 36, 64
//	A call of writeSquares(1); prints 1. The method should throw an 
//	IllegalArgumentException if it is passed
//	a value less than 1.
